Hi there!

🙋‍♀️ We are Isabella and Juliana Wall, twin sisters who love to collaborate and code on different projects together.

🌈 Our projects span across a variety of functions, from data analysis to video games to website creation.

👩‍💻 Languages used so far are: Python and HTML.

🍿 Fun Fact about us: We are currently playing through God of War Ragnarok. And while we are passionate about coding, we also both really love fashion!

🧙 We hope you enjoy our projects!
